Four most important types of graph models:

* Undirected graphs have simple connections

* di-graphs where the direction of each connection is significant

* edge-weighted graphs where each connection has an associated weight

* edge-weighted di-graphs where each connection has both a direction and a weight.

A graph is a set of vertices (points) and a collection of edges (lines) that each connect a pair of vertices.

UNDIRECTED GRAPHS:

We use names 0 to V-1 as names for our vertices in a V-vertex graph. (V nr of vertices), this is so that we can use array indexing to access information corresponding to each vertex.

Can use symbol table to establish a 1-1 mapping to associate V arbitrary vertex names with the V integers between 0 and V-1.

v-w regers to an edge that connects v and w, w-v refers to the same edge.

Two simple anomalies:

* A self-loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself

* Two edges that connect the same pair of vertices are parallel.

These are allowed but not included in the examples.
